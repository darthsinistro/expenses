1. Specify the input file in the same folder and the output df name
2. use tidyxl to read the file.
3. Convert unstructured data into structured form - Date, Category, Amount, Comments
4.

The tidyxl package has been upgraded, thus leading me to re-write the code. Might as well go the whole way. First of all, I won't want to get stuck on small problems. I will learn to deal with them later.

1. Load entire dataset into R
2. Transform it to get a lost of all cells with expenses - date and category, number, comments


x. Calculate the category-wise sum for each day of the year
x+1. Basis the original sheet, calculate the pro-rata projected expense for that category for that day
	Month, Category, Planned Total, Planned Daily
x+2. Calculate the difference
x+3. Arrange the differences in descengind order and calculate cumilative sum of deviations
x+4. Subset entries where cum dev <= 73000
x.5. Take table of category in this max deviation

Now that the above is done, we're moving on to a RCA.

Now I want to write about my approach to the project.

Load Expense Data into R - Data was stored in the form of an excel sheet with comments. The data is divided into categories which I create. Each month, I create a budget based on my overall ability, last month's expenses and my understanding of how my expenses will be like.

Transform data into day-wise observations - Take individual expenses for each day in each category. Aggregate it for the day (category wise prorata doesn't work as well)
Add features to each daily observation - Create a daily deviation from the daily pro-rata and %age of deviation to create a measure of relative and absolute deviation. Also create a cumilative expenses variable. Also assign a category to each day, which is the category in which the highst absolute expense took place that day.
Explore Expense data and conclude cause of deviation - Look at a time based scatter plot of deviations, colored by category so as to give a visual representation of ongoing trends.
Use word-cloud to increase awareness of excess spending

Now I want to start asking questions.

1. Is there a general pattern that preceeds wasteful expenses?
2. Are wasteful expenses isolated instances that cannot be predicted in advance or do they happen in clusters causing more damage together than individually?
3. What is a wasteful expense anyway? - Date, month, time, day, amount, category, comment, deviation from prorata, abs deviation.
